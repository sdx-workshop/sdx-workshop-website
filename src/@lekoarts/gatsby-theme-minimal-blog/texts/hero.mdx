The Sound Demixing Workshop is the official academic follow-up of the 
[Sound Demixing Challenge 2023](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/sound-demixing-challenge-2023/), sponsored by Sony, Moises.AI and Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs.

The event offers a focused forum for researchers, scholars, and practitioners to discuss and share advancements in the field of audio signal processing.

It features peer-reviewed presentations and panel discussions that cover a range of topics, from machine learning-based approaches to real-world applications in fields such as music production and entertainment.
By facilitating interdisciplinary dialogue, the workshop aims to advance the state of the art in sound source separation techniques and encourage their practical implementation.

The relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

- music and movie demixing / source separation
- representation learning for musical instruments and mixtures
- Generative models for music and movie sound
- applications of music demixing and filtering
- self-supervised music and movie processing
- deep neural networks for very long waveforms
- machine learning with applications on music stems and mixture signals
